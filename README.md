[Imagen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487): Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding.

[Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) - A text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation.
